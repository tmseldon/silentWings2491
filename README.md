# Silent Wings 2491

_Silent Wings 2491 is a lite scrolling shoot'em up with some roguelike elements. However, you CANNOT shoot in this game! you can only evade your enemies and their bullets. Your objective: look for someone who could help you 'heal' your airplane while surviving the enemies attacks._
